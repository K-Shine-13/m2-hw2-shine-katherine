                    <h2>Personal History with Design</h2>
                        <p>Before I was a graphic designer, I was a doodler. It started as a habit; idly making little scribbles in the margins of my school notes in class and on countless sheets of printer paper at home. And after several years, I still haven't kicked the habit. The only difference now is that I do it proffesionally as a graphic designer.</p>

                        <p> Even though I didn't major in graphic design, it's probably my most long-standing hobby next to art. Even as an Advertising major, graphic design played a big role in several classes, so I was always getting the chance to experiment and learn more about it despite not declaring it as my major. That's the funny thing about graphic design; it pops up where you'd least expect it.</p>

                    <h2>Design Tips</h2>
                        <p> Over the years, I'd like to think that I've developed a pretty functional, extensive knowledge of graphic design. If I had to describe it in very simple terms, I'd say its both equal parts a science and an art, as there is just as many rules and guideleins that go into it as there is pure creativity and intuition. In my experience, I'd say these are my top tips for designer success:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li> <b>Seek Inspration</b></li>
                                <li> <b>Make Whatever with Whatever</b></li>
                                <li> <b>Build a Portfolio</b></li>
                            </ol>  

                        <h3>Seeking Inspiration ‚ú¶</h3>
                            <p>Before even sitting down to make a design, it helps to have a library of ideas and inspiration floating around in your head. Now, in the age of the internet, it's never been easier for designers to start compiling their own library of inspiration. Personally, I utilize sites such as <strong> Pinterest </strong> the most, as it's an excellent one-stop shop to find inspiration for almost any kind of project. Be it moodboards, font pairings, typography, document layout, product design, and <b> much more </b></p>

                        <h3>Making Whatever with Whatever ‚ú¶</h3>
                            <p> A common misconception that may people have about graphic design is that there is a requirement of expensive tools right out of the gate. But this isn't true (at keast not until you get a bit further into the industry).</p>
                            <p> While industry standard tools like <strong> Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator,</strong> and <strong>InDesign</strong> are considered standard for a reason, there are several tools that designers can add to their toolbox to start making art/designs before jumping into the Adobe pool.</p>
                            <p> Some of my personal favorite of these tools include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Krita:</b> a free, open-source drawing program. It is constantly being updated with new, intuitive features, and offers a wide variety of useful tools, such as an animation mode and a wide variety of export capabilities, to make various projects. </li>
                                    <li> <b>Canva:</b> a powerful and versatile web-based design program. Though there is a paid version of this site, I got away with using the free version for several years before taking the dive. Even in its free version, designers are granted access to a vast amount of templates, fonts, assets, and more to create almost anything you can think of.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Unsplash:</b> a source for high-quality, free-use images.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <p>By using a combination of these tools (along with any that you may already know of), anyone can start on their own design journey, and start creating work to build their skills. It's important to keep in mind that the most important part of designing is the idea that you just have to make it first, and you can always make it "good" later.</p>        


                        <h3>Building a Portfolio ‚ú¶</h3>
                            <p> After designing enough content, it's best pratice to start displaying your best work in a <strong> portfolio.</strong> A portfolio is essentially you on a plate; it's meant to showcase your best work and demonstrate your design process, so that others can see and appreciate your work as much as you do. Keeping your portfolio up-to-date and refreshing is always important, since people will want to see both your new work as well as your older work.</p>
